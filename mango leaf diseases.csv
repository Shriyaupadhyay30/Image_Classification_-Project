Disease ,Description ,Symptoms ,Solution
Sooty Mould,"Sooty mould is a fungal disease caused by the growth of black, velvety fungi on mango leaves, stems, and fruits due to honeydew secreted by sap-sucking pests like aphids and mealybugs which block sunlight, hinders photosynthesis, and reduces fruit yield.",Black sticky coating on leaves.,"Control pests, wash leaves, fungicides."
Powdery Mildew,"Powdery mildew is a fungal disease that primarily affects mango flowers, young shoots, and leaves. It thrives during the flowering season, especially in dry climates with warm days and cool nights.","A grayish haze visible from a distance due to fungal conidia and growth.

White powdery fungal patches on the surface of flowers, young shoots, and leaves.

Infection on the underside of young leaves, especially along veins, sometimes spreading to the upper surface. 

Distorted, curled, and stunted young leaves and panicles.","Sulfur-based fungicides, pruning."
Healthy,"The mango leaf exhibits signs of good health, with a vibrant green color, smooth texture, and no visible damage or disease.",The leaf is healthy,"To maintain the mango leaf's health,
ensure it receives adequate water,
proper sunlight, and regular monitoring for pests or diseases."
Gall Midge,"Mango Gall Midge is a major pest of mango that induces gall formation (small, pimple-like bumps) on mango leaves affecting mango growth and reduces yield.","Formation of small raised, wart-like galls on leaves

Premature curling and dropping of heavily galled leaves

Small emergence holes where larvae leave galls

Secondary fungal infections through exit holes

Dieback of branches in susceptible cultivars

Reduced inflorescences and mango fruit yield

Exit holes on the lower side of young fruits near the point of attachment to the inflorescence.","Prune and destroy infested branches.

Maintain field hygiene and remove weeds.

Plant resistant mango varieties.

Plough orchards to expose larvae and pupae to sun.

Use insecticides like KINGCODE ELITE® 50EC and LEXUS® 247SC.

Use sticky traps to catch adult flies.

Avoid moving infested plants."
Die Back,"Die Back is a serious mango tree disease caused by the fungus Botryodiplodia theobromae. It typically appears during October-November, but can be observed at any time of the year. The disease results in the drying of twigs and branches, defoliation, and a scorched appearance.","Drying of twigs and branches.

Complete defoliation (tree looks scorched).

Discoloration and darkening of the bark.

Dark area spreads along veins of leaves.

Affected leaves turn brown with rolled margins.

Twig or branch dies and shrivels.

Leaf fall with yellowish-brown gum exudation.","Pruning of diseased twigs 2-3 inches below the affected portion.

Spraying Copper Oxychloride (0.3%) on infected trees.

Pasting the cut ends of pruned twigs with Copper Oxychloride (0.3%)."
Cutting Weevil,"A pest affecting mango leaves, causing 'windowpanes' and defoliation through external and internal feeding.","Young leaves cut and falling

1stripped shoots

transparent patches on leaves.","Collect and burn infected leaves, plough the soil to kill pupae. 

Apply insecticides (trichlorphon, deltamethrin, fenvalerate) when young leaves are 3 cm wide, with 2-3 applications weekly. 

Use phenology and duration methods to monitor pest activity."
Bacterial Canker,"A bacterial disease causing cankers on mango leaves, stems, and fruits; severe losses up to 50%.","Water-soaked spots on leaves (1–3 mm)

raised black angular lesions with chlorotic halos; lesions crack

turn white/grey; defoliation; raised

blackened","Use resistant cultivars, apply copper-based bactericides during rainy weather,
use pathogen-free planting materials, establish windbreaks, 
prune infected twigs, and protect fruit using scheduled sprays."
Anthracnose,"A fungal disease caused by Glomerella cingulata, affecting mango production in wet areas.","Small dark spots on inflorescence coalescing under rainy conditions

dark flecks on leaves/stems","Avoid wet areas, plant resistant varieties,
prune diseased branches, remove debris,
use fungicides (benomyl, captan, copper sulfate, sulfur, etc.) 
during flowering and fruit development."
