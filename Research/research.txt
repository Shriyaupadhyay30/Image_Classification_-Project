### Prepare another model for the classes  where the previous model is underperforming




1. Augment the Data (Even with Balanced Classes)
Although you mentioned that your data is balanced, data augmentation is still a crucial technique, especially in image classification, to improve model generalization. It artificially increases the diversity of your training dataset by applying transformations like rotations, flips, brightness adjustments, and crop variations, which helps the model learn more robust features.
	Typical augmentations:
o	Rotation: Random rotation of images to simulate different orientations.
o	Flipping: Horizontal and vertical flips.
o	Zooming: Random zoom to handle varying scales of disease on leaves.
o	Brightness/Contrast adjustments: Helps with different lighting conditions.
o	Shear: Apply shear transformations to simulate image perspective changes.


STACKING:

The hierarchical classification approach involves two stages:

Stage 1: Binary Classifier (High Accuracy Diseases vs. Other Diseases)

Objective: Classify the leaf into one of two categories:
Class 0: First two diseases (high accuracy).
Class 1: All other diseases.
Model: A binary classifier (e.g., CNN or ResNet).
Data: Create binary labels where images of the first two diseases are labeled as 0, and the rest are labeled as 1.
Outcome: The model quickly distinguishes whether the leaf is from the high-accuracy diseases (Class 0) or needs further classification (Class 1).
Stage 2: Multiclass Classifier (Classify Among Remaining Diseases)

Objective: For images labeled as Class 1 in Stage 1, classify them into the specific diseases they represent.
Model: A multiclass classifier (e.g., CNN or ResNet) trained on the remaining diseases.
Data: Use images labeled as Class 1 (other diseases) from Stage 1 and retain their original labels.
Outcome: Classify the remaining diseases accurately, leveraging the distinction made in Stage 1.
Process Flow
Stage 1: The binary classifier is used to predict whether the leaf belongs to the first two diseases (Class 0) or to other diseases (Class 1).
Stage 2: If the binary classifier predicts Class 1, a multiclass classifier is used to identify which of the remaining diseases the leaf belongs to.
Advantages of the Approach
Improved Efficiency: The first stage simplifies the problem by separating high-accuracy classes, allowing the second stage to focus on the more complex cases.
Accuracy Boost: By using two models tailored to different parts of the classification task, both models can specialize in their respective areas, improving overall accuracy.
Scalability: The approach can easily be extended to handle more diseases by adding more stages, should that be necessary.
