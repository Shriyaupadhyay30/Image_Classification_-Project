1,Anthracnose,"Anthracnose is a fungal disease that affects many plants. It causes dark, sunken lesions on leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits. It also attacks developing shoots and expanding leaves. It can spread very quickly during rainy seasons. It is caused by a host specific species of the fungus Gnomonia (asexual stage named Gleosporium). Fungal spores overwinter in infected twigs, branches or fallen leaves and are spread by wind and rain the following season.","Generally appears first as small, irregular yellow or brown spots. These spots darken as they age and may also expand, covering the leaves.","1. Plant resistant plants, or buy healthy transplants. 
2. Plant your plants in well-drained soil. You can also enrich the soil with compost to help plants resist diseases.
3. Water your plants with a drip sprinkler, as opposed to an overhead sprinkler. Don’t touch the plants when they are wet.","1. Remove and destroy any infected plants in your garden. For trees, prune out the dead wood and destroy the infected leaves.
2. Try spraying your plants with a copper-based fungicide, though be careful because copper can build up to toxic levels in the soil for earthworms and microbes. ",https://www.almanac.com/pest/anthracnose ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,Bacterial Canker,"Bacterial canker is a disease caused by two closely related bacteria that infect the stems and leaves. Cankers begin to form in mid-spring and soon afterwards shoots may die back. Shotholes appear on foliage from early summer. The bacteria exist as surface dwellers (epiphytes) on leaves and, during wet weather in spring or early summer, can enter through the leaf pores (stomata), causing infections to develop in the young leaves. ","1. The disease attacks the leaves, leaf stalks, stem and fruits.
2. On the leaves disease first manifests itself as minute, water soaked irregular lesions, black and is surrounded by chloratic haloes.
3. Due to vein limitations the spots become angular and result in cankerous patches, which sometime dry up.","These include regular inspection of plants for early signs of disease, proper sanitation to remove and dispose of infected material, and avoiding unnecessary wounding of plants. It's also important to maintain overall plant health, as stressed plants are more susceptible to disease.","1. Cut out all cankered areas, pruning back to healthy wood and painting promptly with a wound paint to protect the wound from re-infection. ","1. https://www.rhs.org.uk/disease/bacterial-canker

3,Cutting Weevil,"The mango leaf-cutting weevil is a pest native to tropical Asia, affecting mango trees significantly. Adult weevils feed on young leaves, creating ""windowpanes,"" and females lay eggs in cavities along the midrib of leaves. Once eggs are laid, females cut the leaf near its base, causing it to fall. Larvae develop inside the fallen leaves, pupating in the soil. The life cycle continues when adults emerge and infest new foliage.","1. Browning, curling, and crumpling of young leaves.
2.  ""Windowpane"" feeding marks on leaf surfaces.
3. Fallen leaves containing eggs under the tree.
4. Stripped shoots visible from a distance.","1. Regularly collect and destroy fallen leaves containing eggs to reduce larval populations.
2. Plough the soil under tree canopies to disrupt pupation.
3. Inspect trees regularly, especially during young shoot development or early rainy seasons, for early pest detection","1. Use insecticides such as deltamethrin or fenvalerate when young leaves are approximately 3 cm wide. Reapply as needed, especially after rain, to maintain effectiveness.
2.  Maintain good orchard hygiene and ensure early removal of infested leaves to minimize damage","1. https://ijsr.in/upload/1403145976Chapter_24.pdf

4,Die Back," Die back is one of the serious diseases of mango. The disease on the tree may be noticed at any time of the year but it is most conspicuous during October-November. The disease is characterized by drying of twigs and branches followed by complete defoliation, which gives the tree an appearance of scorching by fire.","It is evident by discoloration and darkening of the bark. The dark area advances and extends outward along the veins of leaves. The affected leaf turns brown and its margins roll upwards. At this stage, the twig or branch dies, shrivels and leaf falls. This may be accompanied by exudation of yellowish brown gum",,Pruning of the diseased twigs 2-3 inches below the affected portion and spraying Copper Oxychloride (0.3%) on infected trees controls the disease. The cut ends of the pruned twigs are pasted with Copper Oxychloride (0.3%).,https://nhb.gov.in/pdf/fruits/mango/man002.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,Gall Midge,"The mango leaf gall midge (Procontarinia pustulata), also known as the mango gall fly or mango cecid fly, is a tiny insect (1-2 mm long) whose larvae induce gall formation on mango leaves. These galls are raised, blister-like structures that can appear in various colors, including green, yellow, red, or brown, depending on their age. The pest is primarily active in the early growing season and targets tender young leave.","1. Formation of round, blister-shaped galls (2-3 mm in diameter) on mango leaves.
2. Galls can appear on both leaf surfaces, sometimes merging into larger deformities.
3. Curling and deformation of leaves.
4. Reduced photosynthesis and premature leaf drop in severe infestations.",,"1. Encourage natural predators such as parasitic wasps (Platygaster spp.) and predatory insects like ladybugs that target gall midges.
2. Regularly monitor orchards during the early growing season.
3. Remove and destroy infested leaves and prune heavily affected branches to limit the pest's spread.
4. Apply insecticides like imidacloprid or spinosad to affected areas. Use these sparingly to minimize harm to beneficial insects and prevent resistance development.",https://infonet-biovision.org/PlantHealth/MinorPests/Mango-gall-flies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,Powdery Mildew,"Powdery mildew (Oidium mangifera) is a fungal disease that expresses itself as a white, powdery
growth on leaves, flowers and young fruit. Once infected the flowers are shaded before forming
fruits, young leaves curl while the old leaves and the stem remain longer with white
powdery cover. The disease is spread rapidly by wind. The fungus remains on an
infected tree for a long time and it is more prevalent in dry weather when humidity starts
building up","It starts as white patches on the leaves, making them look like they have been dusted with baby powder. Early on, it wipes off or washes away, only to return again.","Powdery mildew can be prevented through an integrated management system which consists of selection of tolerant varieties, cultural practices .","The most effective way to control mango powdery mildew on very susceptible varieties is to
apply well timed fungicide sprays. Most of the fungicides registered for powdery mildew control
on mango can be effective. The first spray is applied when flower buds are opening with follow
up sprays every 7–14 days until fruit set . The fungicides reported for control of
mango powdery mildew include Bayleton, Benlate, and Karathane. ",https://www.kefri.org/MANGO/pdf/Powdery%20mildew.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,Sooty Mould,"Sooty moulds consist of a large number of different fungi producing dark growth and spores. Commonly found within sooty mould growth are species of Cladosporium and Alternaria, but there are many others. They grow on sugar-rich honeydew produced by sap-sucking insects as a result of their feeding activities, or occasionally on sugary exudates produced by the plant itself.","1. Black or dark brown, superficial fungal growth on the aerial parts of plants, particularly the upper leaf surfaces.
2. The amount of growth can vary from a fine soot-like or powdery deposit, to a thick sheet of growth that may crack or peel away from the leaf surface during dry conditions.
3. Sap-sucking insects such as aphids, scale insects, mealybugs or whiteflies can often be found on the plant, above the point where the sooty mould is growing.
",,"1. Wiping or sponging affected leaves and other plant parts with water is sometimes enough to remove the sooty mould growth. However, if the source of the problem is not dealt with then the growth will develop again.
2. Avoid adding strong soaps or detergents to the water as these can scorch foliage.
3. Lukewarm water can be more effective.
4. Heavy coverage can take some weeks or months to be washed away by rain even if the insect producing the honeydew has been controlled.",https://www.rhs.org.uk/biodiversity/sooty-moulds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
