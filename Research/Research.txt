Feature Engineering Parts
- Image normalization and scaling
- image augmentation (Rotations, brightess, flips)
- handling input sizes and channels
- class label
- Batch Processing

How does Pixel Intensity helps the model?
helps to understand the image better and see the features and patterns on the image
helps to identify textures patterns
help to differential objects in image

How does edge detection helps the model?
helps to focus on main object of the classification which is leaf in this one
simplifies the image
object boundaries 

Why Sequential Model?
Simplicity as its linear stack of layers, beginner friendly
Its compatibility with CNNs.
Layer by layer progression

What is CNN?
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a deep learning models designed for structured grid data like image processing. Its use for object detection, classification.

how does it work?
Convolution layer (applies filter layer over image to detect features like edges colors)
Activation function (ReLU - Rectified Linear unit) applied to lean complex pattern
Pooling layer (reducing dimension by down sampling),
Dense Layer (After convolution and pooling Dense layer makes prediction based on leanred feature

What is regularization?
Techniques used by ML and deep learning to prevent model from overfitting. (L1, L2, Elastic Net) It introduces constraints and penalties .
it helps for simpler models, generalization

What is Epoch?
is it one complete pass of the entire training dataset, it is done multiple times to not miss any thing on the dataset and for model to learn it properly.

What does Precision, recall, f1-score, accuracy and support show?
Precision - Proportion of correct prediction (to minimize false positive) 
Recall - sensitivity or TP rate ( When you need to minimize false negative)
Accuracy - Accurate predication
Support - number of actual occurrence

Macro avg and weight
macro avg - gives equal weight to each class
weight avg - class imbalance
